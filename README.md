# Motor-Trend-Data-Analysis
This project analyses the `mtcars` dataset from the *Motor Trend* US magazine. The relationship between the `mpg` variable and the other variables is examined and their effects. Particularly, we want to know which of the transmission types is good for the `mpg` feature. We also try to quantitaviely describe the relationship. The t confidence interval is observed for the variation in the transmission types and we were able to ascertain that, the different transmission types were significant to the data. Different model were then fitted to get a best fit. These models were analysed and a suitable model was achieved. We were able to determine the relationship between a  car with manual and automatic transmission types leaving other variables constant. Specifically the model implied, given that weight and 1/4 mile time are held constant, manually transmitted vehicles are 14.079 + (-4.141)*wt more in the `mpg` values than automatic ones. Looking at the value, we deduce that a light manual transmission and a heavy automatic transmission car have higher mpg values.
